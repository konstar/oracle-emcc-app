## Overview
The Oracle Enterprise Manager (EM) for Grafana Plug-in allows you to integrate and display EM Metrics data in Grafana. EM collects extensive metric data from various managed targets, and this plug-in allows you to leverage this data for your use cases. You can create custom EM-based Grafana dashboards by browsing and selecting the EM metrics of interest, or for advanced use cases running SQL queries against the EM Repository’s SDK views or Target Databases. The Plug-in is an extension to EM’s data visualization capabilities for added dashboard customization supported by Grafana.
